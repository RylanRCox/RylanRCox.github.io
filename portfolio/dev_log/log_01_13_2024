### Updates

Alright, I finally got some time to be able to work on my portfolio.

I created majority of the layout today, build my 4 main sections and my navbar. I also made a navigation arrow to move around the page.

My plan moving forward is to fill out the rest of my sections with all relevant information in a reasonable format. After that I want to make the page design a lot cleaner and more appealing. Add in some more effects, some patterns, and some nice tables to display certain things.
