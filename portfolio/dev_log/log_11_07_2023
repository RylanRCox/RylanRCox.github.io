### Updates

I did minor work today just attempted to get started with something. Using chatGPT and the reacts quick start guide I started up react and tailwind. I ran the following commands:
```
npx create-react-app my-project
cd my-project
```
```
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Small progress but progress non-the-less.
